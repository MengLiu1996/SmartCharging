%% Description
% This script initialises the variable that covers the users (==drivers) of
% the system. The script makes use of the VehicleData that is extracted
% from real driving profiles in the file GetVehicleData. The users are
% driving cars that represent the German EV market in 2019. Therefore, the
% EVs with the highest market share in Germany in 2019 are used as
% references. Their properties regarding market share, battery size,
% vehicle size and consumption were collected from KBA and ev-database.com.
% These information are loaded from a local xsls file. The file covers
% also a guess (because there was not public data!) regarding the 
% distribution of private charger power for each model. Basing on these 
% information and the driving profile, each users is assigned with an real
% EV model and its properties and one driving profile of a vehicle that has
% the same size as the assigned real EV model. Using the guessed charger
% distribution, each user gets a private charger with a certain charging
% power. In addition, some users are assigned with a PV plant, whichs data 
% was downloaded from the sunny portal of SMA. The related files are stored
% in the folder GetSMAData. General information about the dataset is stored
% in Users{1}.

% Description of important variables
%   NumUsers:           The number of users that will be initialised. (1,1)
%   LikelihoodPV:       The likelihood that one users owns a PV plant.
%                       (1,1)
%   AddPV               Control variable to skip the assignment of PV
%                       plants to the Users. Logical
%   Users:              The cell array that covers all user data. The 
%                       first cell contains processing information. Inside
%                       the following cells, the user data is stored, 
%                       each as a struct. cell (NumUsers+1,1)
%   VehicleSizes        The vehicle sizes that are accepted. In general,
%                       the vehicles in Vehicles have four different sizes:
%                       small, medium, large, transporter. VehicleSizes
%                       determines which of them will be considered for the
%                       users. Two sizes can be merged (considered as one
%                       class) by putting them into one cell {['large',
%                       'transporter']}. In consequence, a real car
%                       with the size large wil lget a driving profile of a
%                       large or transporter vehicle. cell of strings (1,N)
%   PVPlantPointer      A pointer that indicates which PV plant will be
%                       assigned to the next user that owns a PV plant. The
%                       same plant can be assigned to multiple users. (1,1)
%   VehiclePointer      A set of pointer that indicate which vehicle from
%                       Vehicles of a certain vehicle size will be assigned
%                       to the next user. Therefore, there are as many
%                       pointers as VehicleSizes has entries. The first row
%                       corresponds to the first vehicle size (usually
%                       small) and so on. The same vehicle can be assigned 
%                       to multiple users. (N,1)
%   VehicleDatabase     A cell array of N rows. Each row covers the vehicle
%                       numbers of one VehicleSize. cell (N,1)
%   VehicleProperties   The real data of the cars that are assigned to the
%                       users. Covers the car name, market share
%                       (cumulated), size, battery capacity, for
%                       consumption values (cold city, mild city, cold
%                       highway, mild highway) and a guess about the
%                       typical distribution of chargers the usual driver 
%                       of this car have.
%   TemperatureMonths   A first step to consider weather conditions for
%                       energy consumptions of vehicles. Each month is
%                       referred to a general temperature indicator between
%                       1 and 2. Small values represent cold temperatures
%                       and the other way around. The values are estimated
%                       from a climate chart for Germany. The first colum
%                       represents the month number, the second column the
%                       temperature indicator. (12, 2)
%   TemperatureTimeVec  The temperature indicator for each entry within
%                       Time.Vec. Therefore the months of Time.Vec are
%                       matched with the first col of TemperatureMonths.
%                       (M,1)
%   UsersTime.VecLogical Indicates which entries of Vehicles logbook are
%                       used within the given time interval set in
%                       Initialisation. If the Vehicles were processed with
%                       the same time interval, than all entries of this
%                       variable are one. Time points that are only part of
%                       Vehicles are deleted from the logbooks.
