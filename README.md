# Smart Charging algorithm considering multiple revenue opportunities

This project proposes a smart charging algorithm based on linear programming that minimizes the charging costs of an aggregated fleet. The algorithm reduces spot market purchase costs, increases self-consumption of photovoltaics power, enables the provision of negative secondary control reserve and considers the terms of a peak load avoidance program managed by German distribution system operators. The economic potential of each revenue opportunity is examined by using simulations basing on multiple real data sources.
